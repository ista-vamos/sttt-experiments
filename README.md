# FASE 2023 Artifact

NOTE: this README is available also in HTML or PDF format.

## Summary

This artifact contains a prototype of a runtime monitoring middleware called
VAMOS as discussed in the FASE 2023 paper _VAMOS: Middleware for Best-Effort
Third-Party Monitoring_ by Marek Chalupa, Stefanie Muroya Lei, Fabian
Muehlboeck, and Thomas A. Henzinger. The artifact consist of the software,
benchmarks discussed in the paper, and a set of scripts to run experiments
and present the results.

## Hardware Requirements

For all benchmarks to make sense, the artifact requires a reasonably modern
(~past 5? years) x86-64 processor with multiple cores (ideally at least 6 cores).


## Using a bundled docker image

[TBD]

## Building the artifact

To build and run the artifact run this command from the top-level directory:

```
docker build . -t vamos:fase
```

If you are on a new enough Linux system, you may use this command to get
faster builds:

```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f Dockerfile.buildkit -t vamos:fase
```

The building process can take more than 10 minutes, based on the used machine
and the speed of the internet connection.

To run the built image, use:

```
docker run -ti -v "$(pwd)/results":/opt/results vamos:fase
```

This command starts a docker container with experiments ready to run and gives
you a shell in this container. It also creates a folder `results/` in the
current directory to the container where will the results of the experiments
appear. Feel free to change `$(pwd)/results` to a directory of your choice.

Once in the docker container, continue with the test instructions below.

## Test Instructions

We have prepared script to run two versions of experiments: short and full
experiments. Short experiments run just a few minutes, but the results may
slightly diverge from the results in the paper. You can run short experiments
with:

```
./short-experiments.sh
```

Full experiments are run with

```
./full-experiments.sh
```

Full experiments can run for several hours and should reproduce numbers from
the paper. Note that running full experiments will overwrite results of short
experiments. A guide on how to run just some experiments is at the end of this
document.

Once (short or full) experiments are finished, plots in the PDF format should
be automatically generated and put in the results folder from where the docker
was started (or in a folder of your choice if you changed the command). The
plots are named after the figures in the paper.

You can also generate the plots manually by running make in the `plots`
directory. Moreover, you can generate the plots from the original data that we
measured. The data are in `plots/original-data` and you generate the plots by

```
cd plots
make original
```

For more details about plots, check the README.md inside `plots` directory.

## Running just some experiments

To run just some experiments, you can comment out lines with experiments in
`{short,full}-experiments.sh` scripts and rerun these scripts or you can follow
what these script do:

First, pick if you want short of full experiments and according to that, copy
`scripts/setup-short.sh` or `scripts/setup-full.sh` into `setup.sh` (we are in
the top-level directory now):

```
cp scripts/setup-short.sh setup.sh   # short experiments
cp scripts/setup-full.sh setup.sh   # full experiments
```

Then, go into directories with experiments and run `make experiments` in the directory, for example:

```
cd scalability
make experiments
```

Available experiment directories are `scalability`, `primes`, `bank`,
`bank-tessla`, and `dataraces`. The only exception from this pattern are
primes-tessla experiments that are run from the `primes` directory using `make
experiments-tessla`:

```
cd primes
make experiments-tessla
```
